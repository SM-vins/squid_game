                                                       HOPSCOTCH FROM SQUID GANE 

GAME DESCRIPTION:

Hopscotch, a popular children's game, similarly like that game I will introduce ‘SQUID GAME’ in this proposal. In real time, in Hopscotch, we have to jump from one block to another, avoid some of them along the way, and then make our way back. However, in the ‘SQUID GAME,’ there is no-backward; moreover, there is a bridge with a glass square, and that square is side-by-side. Make two lines with five sections. The interesting thing about the game is that in every segment there are two glasses, one of which is tempered glass (which will be easy to break), and the other is permanent glass, where the user can stand there. Now users have to decide within 30 seconds which glass is permanent to move forward and survive in this game. in terms of how to play the game, so it will be elaborated further.

HOW TO PLAY:

This is a single-player, single-mode game initially. The user's only tool for playing this game is the mouse. When the player clicks the left mouse button on a block that has an arrow, they can travel in that direction. Users have to do this five times in the given time to win the game. Next, based on their completion time, the user receives a score. The user may view their greatest time with score on the scoreboard. It's also made easier for users by the game's hint feature. There are modifications to the time and score if users utilize the suggestion. If the user utilizes the suggestion instead of earning five points, they only receive two points, and if they use the tip during the timer, they lose five seconds.
